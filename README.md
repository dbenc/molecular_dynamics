# Molecular Dynamics Simulation of simple fluids

Repo storing an MD project for a university course. In this project, I simulated liquid argon using Velocity-Verlet Integration, the Lennard-Jones potential with periodic boundary conditions at constant volume $V$, particle number $N$, and total energy $E$ , for a given density $\rho$ and initial temperature $T_0$ .
